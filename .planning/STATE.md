# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-06)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Carried forward from Phase 1 (still valid):

- Stack: React Native / Expo SDK 54 + Supabase — decided, not up for debate
- Auth: email/password only, expo-sqlite session storage, URL polyfill required
- Navigation: Expo Router with 5-tab bottom navigator
- theme.ts is the single source of truth for all design tokens — no hardcoded colors in components
- WindowedFlatList wraps FlatList with windowing defaults; keyExtractor must be provided by consumers
- expo-sqlite localStorage chosen over AsyncStorage for Supabase session storage
- RLS (SELECT auth.uid()) subquery pattern applied to all user-scoped policies
- handle_new_user() SECURITY DEFINER trigger auto-creates profile on auth.users INSERT
- lazy: false removed from Tabs screenOptions (caused tab unresponsiveness on physical device)

Pivot decisions:
- Product pivoted from Duolingo quiz engine to Skool-like tutor marketplace
- First tutor: Sharone at NWU Potchefstroom, R180/month
- v1.0 is UI-first — payments deferred to v1.1
- Phase 2 quiz engine work (02-01 through 02-03) deprioritized; data foundation (useStudySessionStore etc.) may be reused or removed

### Pending Todos

- Confirm email for ofc.johandp@gmail.com (Supabase email confirmation pending)
- Fix tabs not responding on physical device (lazy: false removed — needs retesting)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
